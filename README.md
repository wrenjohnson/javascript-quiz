This website is a quiz on the topic of JavaScript.

I used the languages HTML, CSS and JavaScript along with Git Bash and VSCode to complete this project.

This website contains a few buttons to start the quiz, view highscores, clear highscroed and go back to start page. Once you click the start button you will be shown a series of questions to answer.
